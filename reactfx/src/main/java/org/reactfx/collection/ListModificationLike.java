/**
 * Describes an elementary modification made to a list. Elementary modification
 * is represented by the position in the list where the change occurred
 * ({@link #getFrom()}), a list of elements removed by the modification
 * ({@link #getRemoved()}), and the number of added elements replacing the
 * removed elements ({@link #getAddedSize()}).
 *
 * <p>Subtypes of this interface differ in how they refer to the added elements:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link ListModification} holds a reference to the observable list
 *     in which the modification occurred and the
 *     {@link ListModification#getAddedSubList()} method returns a sublist view
 *     of the original observable list. Such sublist is valid only until the
 *     next list modification.
 *     <li>{@link MaterializedListModification} has its own copy of added
 *     elements ({@link MaterializedListModification#getAdded()}), thus the
 *     validity of the list of added elements returned from {@code getAdded()}
 *     is not restricted.
 *     <li>{@link QuasiListModification} does not provide a way to get the
 *     added elements directly, but has to be combined with the observable list
 *     to obtain {@linkplain ListModification}
 *     ({@link QuasiListModification#instantiate(QuasiListModification, ObservableList)})
 *     or {@linkplain MaterializedListModification}
 *     ({@link QuasiListModification#materialize(QuasiListModification, ObservableList)}).
 *   </ul>
 *
 * @param <E> type of list elements.
